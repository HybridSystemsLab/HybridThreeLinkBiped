## Hybrid Three Link Biped Software Components
This repository contains two directories with Matlab scripts that are part of proofs.  The ParameterVerification directory contains a tool that checks if a set of parameters is valid, see the enclosed readme for more detail.  The BipedSimulator directory contains an example project on how to use the models developed for this project and the simulation environment.  The source code for the biped and control modelling can be found here: https://github.com/HybridSystemsEnvironment/ThreeLinkBipedLib , which is implemented using the hybrid systems environment https://github.com/HybridSystemsEnvironment/HybridSystemsEnvironment.
